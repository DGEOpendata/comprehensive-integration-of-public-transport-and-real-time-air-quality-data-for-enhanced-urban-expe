## Comprehensive Integration of Public Transport and Real-time Air Quality Data

### Overview
This project integrates public transportation schedules with real-time air quality data to provide users with a platform for optimizing travel routes based on environmental conditions and schedule convenience.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pandas library
- requests library

### Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install necessary libraries using pip:
bash
pip install pandas requests


### Usage
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Run the script to fetch and process the data:
bash
python main.py

3. Use the `find_best_route` function to get the best route based on air quality by providing start and end locations.

### Code Explanation
- **Data Fetching**: The script uses `requests` to retrieve data from public transportation and air quality APIs.
- **Data Processing**: The data is converted into pandas DataFrames for easy manipulation and merging.
- **Route Optimization**: The `find_best_route` function filters available routes and selects the one with the lowest PM2.5 level.
